## Downloading Puzzle Inputs

As [Advent of Code puzzle inputs should not be redistribued][aoc-about], you
need to log into Advent of Code and download the puzzle inputs yourself if you
want to run the solutions. Just place the input of each puzzle at
`inputs/dayXX.py`, where `XX` is the zero-padded day number (e.g., `01`).
